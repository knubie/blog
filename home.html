            Carma is a technology start up that is pioneering the Ownerless Car to transform wasted parking lot hours into dynamic mobility services that respond to individual's unique transportation needs. In 2015, Carma joined forces with City CarShare to bring a wider breadth of mobility options to the San Francisco Bay Area. We were tasked with redesigning and rebuilding their website and Content Management System to reflect the new partnership.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because of the extremely quick turnaround required for the project, we were not able to build a custom CMS solution before launch. However we decided to implement a pseudo-CMS solution using a content spreadsheet hosted on Google Docs. The content from the spreadsheet was then dynamically loaded into the site, which allowed the team at Carma to update content on-demand without the need for an expensive custom CMS solution.

            Cocainenomics is Netflix's latest foray into Native Advertising, this time with the Wall Street Journal. It takes the form of a bilingual (Spanish and English) article chronicling the business side of the cocaine trade from the early 60's onward. It centers around the notorious Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar, who happens to be the primary antogonist of Netflix's new show, Narcos.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was tasked with creating an interactive map feature powered by Google Maps that details the vast drug routes employed through several decades from Colombia to the United States and beyond. It uses custom vector route overlays with animated icons that represent on of shipments by land, sea and air. The user is free to pan and zoom in to fully explore the vast network that had reached to several continents by the late 90s. The map also features embed tooltips and info windows to highlight locations of interest that occasionally display clips from the show.

          During my time at Code &amp; Theory I lead several development projects with Maybelling including, <a href="http://www.maybelline.com/thenudespalette.aspx" target="_blank">Dare to Go Nude</a> and <a href="http://www.maybelline.com/Franchise/eye-studio-brow.aspx" target="_blank">Brow Drama</a>. The primary task with these projects was to create re-usable templates that could be utilized in future product launches and marketing campaigns. The projects were primarily front-end efforts that utilized templating engines and SCSS mixins to create content-adaptable code.
